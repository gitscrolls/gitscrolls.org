- Completion rate (90%+ = completed)
- Social share clicks
- Navigation between scrolls
- Performance metrics

### Homepage
- Scroll card clicks
- CTA button clicks

## Privacy Features

- Page views by scroll
- Scroll completion rates
- Average time per scroll
- Social sharing stats
- Performance metrics
- User flow between scrolls

## Troubleshooting

### Analytics not showing?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify website ID is correct
3. Check if umami.js loads successfully
4. Ensure your Umami instance is running

### Database issues?
1. Check database connection string
2. Run migrations: `npm run build-db`
3. Check PostgreSQL logs

## Alternative: Development Mode

If you want to test without setting up Umami:
- All analytics events are logged to browser console
- Open DevTools to see tracked events
- Format: `Analytics Event: [event_name] {data}`
